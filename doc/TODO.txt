TODO
States an event can be in:
in_progress, completed (full?)
States an invite can be in:
									/---> yes
pending ---> noreply ---> maybe
									\---> no
instead of having 5 boolean fields,
have a single "state" field that is a string
which can be one of
pending/sent/yes/maybe/no
An invite can be in one and only one state at a time, so modeling it as multiple boolean fields doesn't make sense. What does it mean for pending to be true and sent to be true?
1. Status page
2. Rake task to send out batches of invites
3. Scheduler to run rake task
