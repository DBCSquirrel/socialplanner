- Add status to events (pending, approved once headcount reached, no headcount required = default approved)
- Invites (initial & for events)--> process
-Logic to only allow events past current time
-^validations in general (admin can only host one at once)
-min/max instead of just headcount (implications on event status)
-admin/event created automatically added to attendees list upon event creation
-ranking/suggestion algorithm

-we have established the need for not only an attendees list, but the list of people invited

Viewing event logic:
-only see an event that you have been invited to AND are friends with (controller logic)



Finish events testing..
  -event should respond_to event.alias(es)
  -events_invitations
  -events_users
  -event.user.confirmed_at
